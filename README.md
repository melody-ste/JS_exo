## JavaScript Introduction

This project is an introduction to JavaScript through 6 different exercises.  
Each script explores a basic concept of the language such as variables, loops, functions, conditions, arrays, and string manipulation.

In this repository, you'll find:
- One `index.html` file
- Six JavaScript files: `script_1.js` to `script_6.js`


## How to Run the Exercises

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Press **F12** (or right-click > "Inspect") to open the **console**.
3. In the `index.html` file, locate this line:

  ```html
  <script src="script_1.js"></script>
4. Change the number (e.g., script_2.js, script_3.js, etc.) to load the corresponding exercise script.
5. Refresh the browser and check the console output to see the result.
